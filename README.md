üöÄ Core Features

3D Digital Twin Globe: A fully interactive, real-texture 3D globe built with react-three-fiber.

Live AI Drone Feed: Uses TensorFlow.js to analyze a live webcam feed (simulating a drone) in the browser. It detects 'persons' (a common cause of fires) in real-time to trigger alerts.

Predictive Fire Spread Simulation: The fire spread isn't static. The backend predicts the fire's growth rate (radius growth) based on live weather data.

Real-Time Weather Intel: The backend fetches live Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed from the Open-Meteo API to power the simulation directly.

Instant Data Pipeline: A high-speed, real-time data connection between the FastAPI (Python) backend and the Next.js (React) frontend using Socket.IO.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (The Data Flow)

The system operates in a continuous loop:

AI Detection (Frontend): The DroneFeed component (webcam) detects a 'person'.

Alert Trigger (Frontend -> Backend): The frontend sends an ai_alert WebSocket event to the backend.

Simulation Start (Backend): The backend sets the fire simulation to active, marks the district, and records the start_time.

Live Intel (Backend): The backend calls the Open-Meteo API to fetch live weather data (Temp, Humidity, Wind) for that district.

Prediction (Backend): Using a "Fire Weather Index" formula, the backend calculates how fast the fire will spread (dynamic_spread_rate).

Data Push (Backend -> Frontend): The backend pushes the new radius and live weatherData to all connected clients via a risk_update event.

Visualization (Frontend):

The FireEffect component on the 3D globe grows according to the new radius.

The "Live Intel" section in the 2D HUD updates with the live weather data.

üñ•Ô∏è Setup & Installation Guide

Follow these steps to run the project on your system.

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18.x or newer)

Python (v3.7 or newer)

Git

1. Clone the Project

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git)
cd Your-Repo-Name


(Use your own GitHub URL)

2. Backend Setup (Terminal 1)

Open your first terminal and navigate into the backend folder.

# 1. Navigate into the backend folder
cd backend

# 2. Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install the required packages (from requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the backend server
python main.py


‚úÖ Your backend is now running at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Leave this terminal running.

3. Frontend Setup (Terminal 2)

Open a new terminal and navigate into the frontend folder from the project root.

# 1. Navigate into the frontend folder
cd frontend

# 2. Install the Node modules
npm install

# 3. Run the frontend app
npm run dev


‚úÖ Your frontend is now running at http://localhost:3000.

4. Access the Project

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

You should see the 3D globe and the HUD status should show "‚óè CONNECTED".

The browser will ask for webcam permission. Allow it.

Come in front of the webcam feed (bottom-right). The AI will detect a 'person', trigger an alert, and the fire spread simulation will begin on the globe!
